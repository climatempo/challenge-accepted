# Climatempo Fullstack Challenge App

## How to run

Use the [api](../api) to run a server with the required data. You can alternatively use [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) using the following command: `json-server -p 3333 db.json`.

After that, install the packages with `yarn install` or `npm install`, then run `yarn start` or `npm start`.

## Running it on the published build

You can open this [link](https://expo.io/@lucasnr/climatempo) on your phone and tap the "Open project using Expo" button. The published build uses the [api](../api) build that is deployed at Heroku. You must have the Expo client app on your phone to do so.
